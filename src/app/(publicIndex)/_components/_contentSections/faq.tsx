    answer: (
      <div>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          VPN is the abbreviation of Virtual Private Network. It establishes
          private tunnels over public networks and encrypts data transmission to
          protect communication between two or more devices.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          VPN provides a series of benefits: through encryption, communication
          data becomes difficult to crack; through tunnels, the details of
          online activities are hidden; with the help of forwarding, network
          traffic appears to come from unrelated IP addresses and locations.

    question: "What are ShadowSocks and ShadowSocksR?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          {`ShadowSocks (abbreviated as SS, also known as ShadowShuttle) is an
          encrypted stateless proxy protocol. It works at the transport layer
          and relays TCP and UDP traffic. It can easily penetrate the most
          powerful national firewall (China's GFW).`}
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          {`ShadowSocksR (abbreviated as SSR) is the main branch of SS. On the
          basis of SS, SSR patched security vulnerabilities, expanded cipher
          suite options, added traffic obfuscation, and improved operator-level
          QoS priorities.`}

    question:
      "Why can your proprietary VPN protocol achieve stable high speed?",

          We understand the principles of internet freedom and put them into
          practice in our code.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Traffic obfuscation and bail freedom are the cornerstones of
          effectively circumventing Internet censorship. Obfuscation disguises
          VPN traffic as normal web browsing, leaving censors indistinguishable;
          bail freedom means that due to the high cost of false blocking,
          censorship agencies will not block traffic that cannot be clearly
          distinguished.

    question: "Do you offer unlimited data plans?",

          All our packages have fixed data limits. However, all packages are
          unlimited speed.

          We have multiple level packages of 50GB, 200GB and up to 5TB, etc. to
          meet your needs in different scenarios.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          We believe our pricing structure is fair and reasonable. Some
          so-called unlimited traffic merchants will use some garbage lines,
          resulting in a very poor internet experience.
